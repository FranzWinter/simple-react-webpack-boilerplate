# simple-react-webpack-boilerplate
It is a very simple webpack configuration for general web development. It offers out-of-box:
- ES6 even for ancient Browsers (thanks to BABEL)
- SASS or CSS depends on what you prefer. Development builds have CSS inline, for Production CSS is in separate file
- React with JSX onboard
- automatic compression for images. Small images (less than 8kB) are converted to inline to reduce requests
- hot module replacement using webpack-dev-server
- tree shaking / dead-code elimination
- caching with user-friendly '[name].[hash].' names
- Service Workers - Progressive Web Application

## Requirements
You need node.js, npm and webpack to use this boilerplate.
I used `node 10.13.0`, `npm 6.4.1` and `webpack 4.26.1`. To avoid problems please make sure you have them up-to-date.  
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (npm is distributed with Node.js)  
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
